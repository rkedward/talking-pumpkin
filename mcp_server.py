"""Remote control for the pumpkin as an MCP server, so an AI assistant (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, ...) can
puppet him, run the show and check on him. His own conversations with kids don't go through here; they stay
in main.py's fast loop. This just talks to the pumpkin's local web API.

Run it on the Pi (it reaches the pumpkin on 127.0.0.1). From a laptop, Claude Desktop can start it over SSH:

    "pumpkin": {"command": "ssh", "args": ["you@pumpkin.local", "~/pumpkin/.venv/bin/python",
                                           "~/pumpkin/mcp_server.py"]}

or on the Pi itself:  claude mcp add pumpkin -- ~/pumpkin/.venv/bin/python ~/pumpkin/mcp_server.py
Set PUMPKIN_URL (and PUMPKIN_KEY from .env) to run it on another machine instead.
